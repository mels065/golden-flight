# Golden Flights
 
  This is an application for booking flights. Our goal was to create a platform where you could find flights on the fly in a sleek and elegant way. The project follows the MVC framwork featuring express-session for authentication, Handlebars.js as the templating language, sequelize as its ORM, and pdfmake as the unique technology of our project.
